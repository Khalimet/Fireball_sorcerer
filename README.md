# Fireball_sorcerer
Stripped down sorc rotation for fireball build S6
Familiar
Fire Ball
Flame Shield
Ice Shield
Teleport
Ice Blades
*also has the teleport_ench but havn't tested*
Have only tested using the Mythic loadout using this guide https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/fireball-sorcerer-guide#season-theme-header
Will only cast Familiar after using Fireball and every 6 seconds after the first time it does, this ensures the buff will always be up to maximize dps :)
